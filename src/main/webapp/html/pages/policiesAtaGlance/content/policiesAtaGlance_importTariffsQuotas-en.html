                <!--The graph compares the average values of MFN applied and final bound ad valorem import tariffs on the 4 AMIS crops (wheat, rice, maize and soybeans) in the AMIS countries. Data on specific or compound tariffs is not considered for this graph, nor are Other Duties and Charges (ODC) and information on mixed commodity classes. The number of notifications differs from year to year and not all countries notify each year. The number of tariff lines (TLS) that are used to calculate the average values depend on the notifications on applied tariffs made in a specific year. For example, if there were notifications on applied tariffs for 20 TLS that relate to wheat in 2010, then the average bound value will be calculated using those 20 TLS. If in the next year, there are were notifications on applied tariffs for 40 TLS that relate to wheat in 2011, then the average bound value will be calculated using those 40 TLS. Hover over a specific bar to display the value of the tariff as well as the number of TLS. Commodities can be removed from the graph by deselecting them from the legend in the graph.-->
