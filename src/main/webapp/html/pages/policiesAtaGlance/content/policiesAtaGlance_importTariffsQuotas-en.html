                The graph compares the average values of MFN applied and final bound ad valorem import tariffs on the 4 AMIS crops (wheat, rice, maize and soybeans) in the AMIS countries. Data on specific or compound tariffs is not considered for this graph, nor are Other Duties and Charges (ODC) and information on mixed commodity classes. The number of notifications differs from year to year and not all countries notify each year. Hover over a specific bar to display the value of the tariff as well as the number of tariff lines. Commodities can be removed from the graph by deselecting them from the legend in the graph.
